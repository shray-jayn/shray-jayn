### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, i'm Shray Jain, a passionate Competitive Programmer and a  self-taught full stack web developer from India.
My passion for software lies with dreaming up ideas and making them come true with elegant interfaces. I take great care in the experience, architecture, and code quality of the things I build.

i am also an open-source enthusiast . I aspire to learned a lot from the open-source community and i love how collaboration and knowledge sharing happened through open-source.
